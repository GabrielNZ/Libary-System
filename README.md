# About the project

I already did this kind of project some mounths ago, but I only used simple JDBC.
So I thought fair to recreate it with my new logic and tecnologies.

The application consists in a Libary System with: 
Users -> each user with authentication via Spring Security, authorizations and roles), 
Books -> each book being registrated by a WebServiceAPI (ISBN)) and
Loans.

The logic of the project is created entirely by me.
